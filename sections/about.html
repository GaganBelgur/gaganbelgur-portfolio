    <h2 class="section-title">About Me</h2>
    <div class="skill-card">
         <p class="card-text">I started my journey in mobile development because
            I’ve always been fascinated by how apps can connect people and devices in meaningful ways. Over the years,
            I’ve worked on apps that help patients monitor medical devices, families breathe cleaner air, and millions
            of users manage their banking.
            Beyond coding, I love solving tough problems, collaborating with diverse teams, and building apps that make
            everyday life easier.<p>
