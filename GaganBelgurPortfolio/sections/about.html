       Hi, I’m Gagan Belgur. I started my journey in mobile development because I’ve always been fascinated by how apps can connect people and devices in meaningful ways. Over the years, I’ve worked on apps that help patients monitor medical devices, families breathe cleaner air, and millions of users manage their banking. Beyond coding, I love solving tough problems, collaborating with diverse teams, and building apps that make everyday life easier.
